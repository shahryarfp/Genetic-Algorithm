# Genetic algorithm for decoding a text
The purpose of encryption is to convert the raw text (message) into ciphertext so that no one but the recipient of the message can understand it. 

The encryption used in this project is done using an encryption key and a table.<br>
The table can be seen here:

For this purpose, first a desired encryption key is selected. Then a new string is created using this key, and finally, using the Vigen√®re cipher table, the encrypted text is created.
